# qr-id.io
The sourcecode of qr-id.io.

Description:
The idea of this website is to provide a platform which is interpreting and showing the data of a qr-code. You can use it to generate a qr-code which contains your name, adress, contact data (telephone number or email), maybe some important information like your blood group or any other important information you want to share in case of an emergency or a bad situation like loosing the case of your headphones.
You can simply download and print the qr-code and stick it on any device or thing you want so if it gets lost, another person can just scan the code and contact you.
You can also copy the url and store it inside an rfid chip, so if you get in an accident and you need emergency help, any other person can scan the tag to get important data, your identity or maybe contact information of your family.

It does NOT store or process any data at the server, the whole thing is only processed by the browser only using javascript, it is completely anonymous!
